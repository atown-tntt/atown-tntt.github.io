# About
Đội Trưởng/Đội Phó (Team leaders and assistant team leaders) is a
leadership program for youth. The youth will need to participate special
training for ten weeks and attend a training camp in the Spring, to develop
skills to lead their classmates. Their motto is “Gương mẫu!”, meaning
“exemplary”. They are identified by the two stripes (Đội Trưởng) or the
single stripe (Đội Phó) on their scarves. All youth are welcome to
participate in this program starting at age 7.
