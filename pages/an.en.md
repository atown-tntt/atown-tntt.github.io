The Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth Movement is a Catholic non-profit organization. We are a
Eucharistic youth group devoted to teaching and leading the next generation of
Vietnamese-Catholics to love and serve God.

Đoàn Thánh Gia (DTG) is one of 143 Chapters of the Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth
movement (VEYM) located in Auburn, Washington. We are a part of the League of Chapters
Ignatius of Loyola in the Pacific Northwest. Our chapter was founded in 2004. From
September to June, we meet every Sunday from 12:30-3pm, with Vietnamese mass at 3pm.

## Our Purpose
The Eucharistic Youth Movement has two general purposes:

* To educate and train youths in becoming a better person as well as an excellent Christian
* To organize and to guide all youths in spreading the Good News of the Gospel and to
actively be involved in working for the good of society through charitable services and
helping others.
