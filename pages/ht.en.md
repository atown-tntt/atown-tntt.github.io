# About
Huynh Trưởng are adult youth leaders who teach and guide the youth.
Their motto is “Phụng sự!”, meaning “to serve”. They wear red scarves,
representing sacrifice and perseverance of hardships, as red as the
sacrificial blood poured out for each of us, with a yellow border
representing joy and hope. All youth leaders undergo training at age 18.
