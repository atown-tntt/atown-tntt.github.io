The Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth Movement is a Catholic non-profit organization. We are a
Eucharistic youth group devoted to teaching and leading the next generation of
Vietnamese-Catholics to love and serve God.

Đoàn Thánh Gia (DTG) is one of 143 Chapters of the Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth
movement (VEYM) located in Auburn, Washington. We are a part of the League of Chapters
Ignatius of Loyola in the Pacific Northwest. Our chapter was founded in 2004. From
September to June, we meet every Sunday from 12:30-3pm, with Vietnamese mass at 3pm.

### Registration
We are happy to share that we will resume having Thiếu Nhi Thánh Thể (TNTT) in person, beginning Sunday, October 3, 2021.
 
Currently, the plan is to alternate sessions weekly based on the divisions of the students, due to capacity concerns. Nganh Au Nhi and Nganh Thieu Nhi will meet first, on October 3, followed by Nganh Nghia Si and Nganh Hiep Si on October 10. The divisions will alternate every week. This plan is subject to change – if the registration numbers allow us to meet with all the kids, every week, we will let you know as soon as possible. Further, as the COVID situation changes, the Thieu Nhi plan will be continually evaluated to ensure the best possible experience for the kids.

Regarding COVID protocols, masks will be required during attendance, social distancing guidelines will be followed, and we will do our best to protect the children as much as possible. TNTT will start at 12:30pm and will end with the children attending 3pm Vietnamese mass. Lunch will not be provided, so please make sure the children eat before attending.  
 
Registration opens Saturday, September 5, 2021. In-person registration is available before and after mass, all through the month of September. Uniforms can also be purchased at in-person registration. Online registration is also available via our website. The registration fee is $70/per child this year. Please ask us about our scholarship options to waive the registration fee. 

Register your child for $70 on before and after mass or online at [this link](https://forms.gle/icjvLytic8ET4obYA).

We are very happy to start classes again and grow in God's love.

## Our Purpose
