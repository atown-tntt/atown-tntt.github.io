You’re invited to Đoàn Thánh Gia’s 17th Bổn Mạng on January 9th, 2021 at 12:45 PM - 2:45 PM in the Parish Hall at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Auburn. To celebrate, our theme this year is “Seventeen The Dream.” This theme represents our hope and joy to be back in person again as a Thiếu Nhi community. So get ready for the dreamy clouds and shining stars and please join us for an afternoon of carnival games, performances, and laughter as we live our dream! Please be sure to wear your masks except when eating or drinking to ensure each and every person’s safety at this event.
