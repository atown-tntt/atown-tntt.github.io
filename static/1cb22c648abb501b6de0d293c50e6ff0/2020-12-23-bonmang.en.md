Dear Chaplains, Clergical Chaplain-Assistant, Lay Chaplain-Assistant, Youth Leaders and everyone in the Sacred Heart Vietnamese Community. You are invited to celebrate the Feast Day of the Holy Family Chapter with Holy Mass of Thanksgiving on Sunday, December 27, 2020 at 3pm at Holy Family Catholic Church.  Due to the COVID pandemic and its restrictions, our Feast Day celebration is going to be livestreamed on YouTube on Sunday, January 3, 2021 from 12:30-2pm. A link will be emailed to the community the week of the livestream. We hope that you can participate with us both in the Holy Mass of Thanksgiving (December 27, 2020) and/or livestream on YouTube celebration (January 3, 2021). We thank you for your prayers, love, and support of the TNTT Holy Family Chapter. We wish everyone a happy, holy, and blessed Feast of the Holy Family.
